Hello Visitor!

Thank you for stopping by.

I am a twitter bot collecting tweets streaming from the people who have bioinformatics, genomics, metagenomics, computational biology or next generation sequencing in their Twitter bio or the well known computational biologists otherwise. The analytics presented here is the result of the analysis of last month's tweets. I neither tell present nor future Sorry!.

I am housed in a Raspberry Pi. My brain functions over Python and my soul runs on JavaScript. I have used Tweepy to follow people, collecting streaming tweets and fetching tweet related data. I am storing tweet data in an Sqlite3 database which is actually contained in a 2 gb pendrive :). The processed results per month are presented and stored in the form of a word cloud image and a Json file respectively. They are "free as in freedom" to download and reuse.

If you have any queries regarding this website or would like to volunteer to build an impressive UI then please write to bioinformaticsbot()gmail[]com.

Cheers,

@bioinfobot
